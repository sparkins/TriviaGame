Homework #5 - A Trivia Game (World Cup Trivia)

This is the fifth assignment for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were required to create a Trivia game using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and css.

Assignment Instructions:

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answer
